perry i like the suit coat thank you i've had a year just like a slob i'm gonna try to like spruce it up generally oh i love that have you heard the phrase hard pants hard pants like pants that aren't sweats yes basically are like leggings i guess for women what have you so i guess yes so my wife was saying that we should do more hard pants days recently [Music] hello and welcome to the 538 politics podcast i'm galen druke some of the most prominent personalities and ideas within the republican party were on display at the conservative political action conference over the weekend the conference is generally thought of as a proving ground for ambitious and up-and-coming republican politicians but this year former president trump was in many ways the star of the show he gave the closing speech where he announced he wouldn't be starting a third party and he spent much of the speech criticizing president biden's agenda falsely claiming he won the election and teasing that he might run in 2024 so today we're going to talk about what if anything we learned from the gop at cpac also last week democrats agenda hit its first big procedural snag the senate parliamentarian ruled that the federal minimum wage could not be raised through reconciliation that's the process the democrats are using to pass their coveted relief package with only a majority of the vote in the senate so we're going to discuss the debate within the party over what to do about this roadblock and the others that are likely to hold up much of the democratic agenda and here with me to do that are senior politics writer perry bacon jr hey perry hi gail also here with us is politics editor sarah frost and said hey sarah hey kaylin and managing editor michael cohen hey micah hey galen hey everybody good to have you it's been a minute it has it's great to be back on the podcast so i want to begin with cpac but let's start with one of our favorite questions which is of course good use of polling or bad use of polling cpac often conducts a straw poll to see who the attendees prefer as the gop's next presidential nominee this year trump won with 55 percent of the vote however the atlantic published a piece a while back that i dug up it's from 2015 but they basically counted the number of times that the cpac straw poll winner went on to win the gop nomination going back decades out of 20 cpac straw polls only four win ultimately got the nomination and then in 2016 of course cruz came in first rubio came in second and trump came in third for years before that ron paul and rand paul were winning these straw polls so essentially i want to use this as a way of getting at how representative cpac is of the republican party so what do you all think is this you know cpac straw poll a good or bad use of polling at least in the sense that it gives us an idea of what the republican party wants or not it's it's a bad use of polling only because it's not a representative group anybody can choose to go to cpac as long as you pay the fee i mean often when i you know used to be in washington so i would go i would go every year for a while and often you'd get a lot of sort of like libertarianish ron paul or rand paul ish young people who are between ages 18 and 24 who could who could honestly afford to take a it's a convention in the middle of a week so well they have days and weekends too but often the straw poll was during the week too so who can take off several days travel to a conference it's not a representative sample of the republican party and i would argue not even a sample of the republican sort of activist base as such so in this case the numbers in the cpac poll line up with the general polling i've seen about trump being 50 60 percent of republican voters won over trump so i don't think it's a bad poll in this sense but i don't think it's really useful as an exercise of where the republican party is even the activist part yeah what's interesting is is maybe it's more representative this year than in past years i don't know why that would be but certainly as perry just referenced in terms of the poll results we saw and i think the general kind of tenor and focus of the conference it lined up with like the broader evidence we have about the what the republican party cares about and is focused on so so maybe it's more representative now as opposed to being dominated by kind of that rand paul ron paul libertarian wing in in years past yeah i was going to say good use of polling too because i do think cpac has kind of gone under a transformation from the period where reagan kind of helped kick it off to the ron paul era to being more on the nose in terms of where part of the activist base is i think perry makes a good point that we shouldn't lull ourselves into thinking that this is the only portion of the gop base that is activists and involved in trying to change politics here but i do think it's indicative of understanding how much at least this section of the republican party really wants trump's policies and approach to politics to carry on for the next four years and to really define the party so what part of the party is this then and why might have cpac become more representative of the broader gop if you agree with with that thesis i mean maybe it's just a coincidence um i don't know uh so you know just to take a couple examples right like there was the cpac poll found that you know about two and three people um wanted trump to run again in 2024 about two and three people thought named election integrity as a top issue that matches up pretty well with polls we have of all republican voters which have found about you know 70 of republicans don't think the 2020 election was free and fair which it was right so put another way about about one in three republicans is ready to move on from trump specifically not trumpism but trump specifically uh according to cpac and according to polls more generally why why it would be more representative this year it could just be a coincidence i don't know if people have other theories well actually i thought usa today put out a good like here's the history of cpac since the 70s and one point they made in that piece was that it's often useful as a harbinger of what's to come like lest we forget you know george w bush went on cpac at one point that kind of hinted at the era of conservative um empathetic politics and the the importance that christian conservatives would have in the party as an intellectual base within it right and then you also saw that with the tea party in 2010 i mean trump's first uh speech at cpac was 2011. and yes he skipped it in 2016 to hit the campaign trail but i do think increasingly you've seen a absence or a transition away from some of the conservative core policies that they would debate and a you know move now into more of like the trumpian tea party birther conspiracy dynamic actually so that's a really good point so here's a theory for why cpac is is more representative maybe it's just a kind of indirect product of the fact that the republican party is now much more homogeneous demographically ideologically than it used to be so maybe in years past you would have at least the semblance of different policy wings within the party and you'd have you know the kind of national security republicans and you'd have the social conservative conservative republicans where now you have you know basically just to focus on white identity issues um and kind of cultural grievances there's less variation within the party for cpac to pick up on and so it inherently has to be more more representative i think what mike is saying just put differently might be that the establishment wing of the party was before kind of unrepresented cpac and now the the whatever the trump wing is is the establishment so in a certain way it's you know it used to be kind of like the romney version of republicanism was not particularly uh was not going to win cpac but was going to win the electorate and now i think those are increasingly um not that's not increasingly the romney mcconnell view is not popular among the electorate or or at cpac or the libertarian wing right or they're libertarian for that matter yeah yeah so should we say this is a good use of polling or bad use of pulling it seems like his we're saying historically it's been a bad use of pulling but this year it's a good use of polling is that true how do we want to label this this so i'm sticking with bad only because i only think the poll is useful because it lines up with the other polls i actually trust yeah that's right that's the right answer that is because i mean i think too you can kind of read this poll any way you want because we're so far out right and we know that it's not predictive of what 2024 will hold also desantis was really high wasn't he like 23 i doubt desantis because the event happened in florida i'm a little bit nervous that desantis is that far ahead of the sort of non-trump republican that may be the case i don't know but the event happening in florida the event happening in washington i thought was a little more helpful because washington tends to get if you're if you're a person who goes to conferences dc is kind of the place you go having it in florida makes you think the governor of florida probably did do better than maybe if it was in illinois i don't know that's definitely true and it's a reason i think to like be skeptical of the desantis result in that poll but it also could be another reason cpac in general is sort of more interesting and more representative is because it's not in dc and florida is a pretty good place to to capture the mood of the republican party i think yeah one thing i'd read too that i thought was interesting was this idea that because of the role that the coronavirus is playing in all of our lives governors might have an easier time on the national stage than senators because they're the ones at home setting the policies about you know yes we're shutting down yes you have to wear a mask or not wear a mask you know it was a talking point of desantis and christie noem of south dakota all right so i wanted to use that in a way to set up how much we can rely on cpac to give us a sense of where the republican party is so important to remember historically not super representative of the party maybe there are reasons to believe that is more representative today but it could also still be the case that it's not representative and and this is you know uh a conglomeration of ideas that are maybe popular today but could fade over the next two years who knows i just want to you know set up those caveats before we talk about cpac in terms of what we can learn about the party more broadly so given that uh what did we learn about the republican party from cpac in terms of what its priorities are its agenda going forward um you know oftentimes after a party loses a big election it has uh you know a moment of reckoning where it tries to figure out how it needs to change or evolve in order to win elections going forward what message did we get from the party about where it thinks its future lies and how the arguments that it's going to make to the american public i guess two points would be there's gonna be a lot it looks like for now at least the kind of what you call the big lie or what have you decided the idea that trump was cheated out of the election is gonna be something that was something most of the speakers either said was true or didn't refute there wasn't a i don't think there's a lot of speakers who were definitively like the election was you know there was a lot of speakers saying we lost we need to rethink republicanism as it stands now it wasn't that kind of conference i think the sort of the idea that the election was taken from trump was a big theme and also this idea of almost all the speakers mentioned someone canceled cancel culture so this idea of which i think plays into these sort of oddities that it is questions around uh race culture multiculturalism so on so i think you you heard that's going to be a focus of the party going forward as well this sort of like identity-ish issues are going to remain a big focus yeah trump even said explicitly you know it was a line something like our very identity as americans is at stake i do think that's right i think i think some combination of white identity politics sort of like cancel cultural grievances um is is sort of the party's north star at the moment well the name of the convention was cpac america uncancelled yeah it yeah it's so interesting because like right now polls show what is it 50 of americans aren't familiar with the with that term and here the gop is very intently going into that as a key point of messaging i mean i assume that will change um just given how much it is increasingly being covered but it does seem like a curious choice to really make that you know the flag point in which you want to campaign on i do wonder how potent of a political issue it will be you know one other really dominant theme you saw in trump's speech for example was immigration right like the first 10 minutes or so 15 minutes or so were were focused on immigration much like his sort of original campaign speech right um but that immigration as an issue didn't have the potency in 2018 or 2020 that that it might happen in 2016. you know if you remember like in 2018 trump tried to make that like migrant caravan a big issue down the stretch that didn't really work um all the republicans kept the senate so i don't know maybe there's a slight caveat there um and then in 2020 obviously you know he he sometimes hit on immigration but it didn't seem to have the the rallying effect it did in 2016. um i do wonder if republicans think that like this idea of liberals are trying to cancel you is a is like a better version of that um that kind of white grievance i don't but it's like white grievance targeted for college graduates you know and like maybe that's cpac's core demographic to some extent yeah it kind of is yeah right and so it's like okay we lost the suburbs in 2018 and in 2020 is this something we can resonate with um in terms of that section of the base that increasingly you know is moving democratic while not moving away from some of the you know explicit dog whistles and other avenues um i don't know i'm still processing that i did want to ask when you know i didn't watch all of the speeches but i watched all of trump's speech and as you mentioned immigration was a big part of it he also talked about school closures uh he talked about china and then some of biden's other executive actions on for example energy the keystone pipeline etc and i'm curious did trump in that opening part of his speech where he did talk about biden's agenda did he give us a blueprint for where republicans think biden's vulnerabilities are or is are those things that are just near and dear to trump or are they actually getting at something that is important in american politics in that you know biden may be vulnerable in those areas energy policy on china school closures immigration i wouldn't i don't think i'd look for much signal there i mean he went through trump went through a lot of issues um he he explicitly like laid out how he defined trumpism um and he attacked biden you know on everything he was like this is the worst month for her administration ever and it was just like kind of so all over the place i'm not sure i you know i'm sure biden is vulnerable on on some of those issues um but that's only because trump like went through every issue right well i mean people certainly picked up on the fact that he really didn't go after the american rescue plan like he said it was expensive and would and would bail out democratic cities but you know this two trillion dollar plan that normally at cpac would have gotten probably a lot of pushback was barely talked about while you know immigration he talked a lot about school closures he talked a lot about china he talked a lot about well i think one thing you're seeing there is like we know that covid relief is broadly popular i think republicans are largely kind of staying silent on that to see how it plays out right like there's no advantage for them to really take a big active stance on it it could prove popular it could prove really complex and unpopular as time goes on i do think though to push back a little on what mica was saying like one thing morning consult is tracking over the next four years is how biden polls on a variety of different issues and of the 14 issues they're looking at which ranges anywhere from climate change to medicare to how he's handling the pandemic the four topics where he was below 50 again we're not saying like zero or bottom but you know in the 40s and 30s we're energy immigration foreign policy and guns so i don't think it was like completely um out of the blue that trump targeted those issues right i think for instance china you know granted that was forecasted as a big issue in 2020 and really wasn't but depending on how the pandemic plays out here in addition to economic recovery in the u.s i could see that becoming more and more of a gop talking point one thing you could tell there wasn't a ton of focus on like biden the way there was and about obama in like previous versions of this and i think obama biden himself is not the easiest target is my impression probably race age ideology he's sort of seen as nice i don't know you get gender you can pick a lot of different ways about that but i think the overall tenor of the left is trying to move america on too many dimensions too quickly it's the left is too woke the left is trying to stop anybody who doesn't agree with their ideology for moving forward i think is a pretty good argument i think it unifies the republican party pretty well it divides the democrats on some elements and if that is where trump and the party are going i think the i think the explicit banning muslims and banning um and talking about mexicans negatively is not as helpful versus cancel culture sort of touches that without actually going there on the issues i think they actually have arrived at a decent and a decent organizing principle for the party yeah i want to actually quote ron desantis uh from his cpac speech he said quote we can sit around and have academic debates about conservative policy we can do that but the question is when the league lights get hot when the left comes after you will you stay strong or will you fold and essentially he says there you know like maybe we shouldn't have some of these detailed policy arguments like the thing that unites us is what you just said like a a kind of fear of the left in a sense and that's kind of what sarah huckabee launched her campaign out in arkansas yeah that seals to me like desantis i think is a pretty good politician he does some of the things i worry about in terms of democratic norms that trump did but he's a but i think he's on the pulse and i don't think that i think that that sort of leads to policies anyway like it means you oppose a lot of states for example trying to ban the 16 19 projects being taught or they're trying to pass laws that says if you defund the police we catch your funding i think texas and florida are doing this there's a lot of things if you're if you're sort of if your politics is organized around the left is doing being too aggressive that actually leads to some policies without actually having to think too much too you know we're opposed to defunding the police is a pretty easy argument actually i guess where i'm struggling a little bit is you could imagine a really um like politically smart party strategy among gop candidates and operatives that got rid of a lot of the racist stuff and sexist stuff and and as perry said instead kind of dressed it all up in um you know kind of like a victimhood of ascent in it in essence like you know that the left as perry said is going after everybody and we need to stand together because et cetera et cetera et cetera um basically like if if the trump era represented you know going from subtext to text on a lot of these issues like trying basically an effort to move all that stuff back into some subtext right um the problem with that is there there's still a lot of text like you know trump speech was full of you know attacks on immigrants and and stuff like that so so you know maybe it is a smart strategy i guess i'm pretty skeptical that it's going to be widely adopted but you know i yeah i could be wrong yeah cause the part of fighting canceled culture right or pushing back on it is you say cancelable things right or things that aren't politically correct as part of that fight i hadn't thought though to the extent like what perry was saying about how that in and of itself though still lends policies um that makes sense right like you know they're pushing back increasingly on you know tech censorship and like you know that's something that holly's made a big part of the senate and wanting to push bills on that i don't think i've appreciated enough about how it's not just rhetoric it can also push through policies even though you wouldn't look at cpac this past week and say oh wow a ton of policies were discussed um but that's a good point that we shouldn't kid ourselves that this doesn't still result in some type of policy i mean the question i guess we'll get to is if you're running in a primary trump has this fame and so on but if rick scott and desantis run as the sort of subtext candidates and marjorie taylor green ran as the text candidate is it easy is it better to be the subtext of the text person and i'm not sure the 2016 prime racist obviously the answer is be the person who says it directly but i'm not sure that's always the case there probably is a way to do the subtext and say i'm a i can imagine like a desantis kind of person is going to hint if i do subtext i can win and if we do texts we might lose and i think that's not an unreasonable and basically my subtext is executing it like rejection is actually accomplishing things in a way that marger taylor green isn't because subtext might actually be getting more votes i think that's not i don't know what's going this is going to play out but i think the subtext going back to subtext is i think where they're headed i think micah frames it really well yeah and of course we'll watch what happens in 2022 i didn't want to frame this conversation entirely around 2024 and i hope that's not the sense that people are getting and listening to it but like these are arguments that are happening within the party right now that are going to play out over the next two years i do though want to ask a question about how we in the media are covering trump right because usually former presidents fade from the spotlight in this case former president trump can run for another term if he wants to and he is certainly making the decision not to fade from the spotlight he is kind of headlining cpac for example so how should we be treating him is everything he says and does newsworthy should we think of him as you know the likeliest 2024 nominee and cover him as such so i guess if trump if if uh in 2017 barack obama had written a letter detailing how much he thinks nancy pelosi sucks that would have been news so i don't so when some of the mcconnell trump thing i think that letter got a lot of coverage and i think should have if barack obama had went to a you know net roots nation or whatever and given a big speech saying michelle is gonna run or what i guess because he couldn't run himself that would have been news too so i think trump every utterance of his is not important but i think there are some things that are important like when he met with marjorie taylor green when they were fighting about what she should happen with her that was significant when he met with mccarthy i mean i think these initial moves are interesting if he does the same moves like six months from now like a letter from trump saying mcconnell sucks two weeks from now is less newsworthy because it already happened but i still think these things matter in the sort of broadest sense what i am leery about is you can see news outlets are assigning reporters to cover trump and some of the reporters are doing lots of sources close to trump said x we don't really need anonymous sources on trump he's not president anymore we only need that kind of like breathless endless dumb coverage that was dumb at the time he was president of times as well and i thought a lot of the height of the of the run-up to his speech we don't need to preview a next president's speech we can just let him give a speech and cover but the previewing seemed weird so i think there are some incentives because of traffic because of how interesting trump is to sort of overcover him and maybe undercover what people with actual governing power who are mayors or governors or state legislators do so i think the question is we should cover like trump-ism how trump-style values are affecting the republican party constantly we should cover donald trump as a human maybe a little less is my sense of it i'd offer two things one is to like just not hand trump the mic and get out of the way i think i think media outlets have mostly learned that lesson um since 2016 so i think that's less of a problem now i was like checking around yesterday during the cpac speech and i think that it was basically only fox who was running the running the speech live i know ms and cnn did not so i think yeah um so that's a big one and then the other one and this is the part where i'm just sort of slightly restating what perry said editors reporters i think should always first ask themselves why are we covering this trump event or trump speech or trump you know action uh whatever it is you know are we covering it as a as a way into the the dynamics in the broader republican party okay fine right um are we covering it because you know trump himself will have sway over some specific let's say a bill is in front of congress and trump is lobbying you know members of you know republicans in congress to vote in a certain way okay fine um but if you don't have a like a ready answer for that question why are we covering this i think maybe maybe stay away and i think as perry said like assigning a reporter to to cover trump as a be is a way of sort of like structurally removing that question as a barrier to doing a to doing journalism about trump because once you assign a beat to someone they're just doing it right there's you're sort of saying structurally we're going to cover this in an ongoing way yeah i mean this is a question i personally struggle with you know being in a newsroom being an editor where i feel like trump has been largely an assignment editor in the last four years right like what he does is news um i do think though increasingly like as the former president there will be shifts in terms of that i do think though as perry said you know in the last week we saw a lot of um hyped up coverage leading up to cpac that was all anonymously sourced that wasn't really adding to you know our understanding of the power he still wields or what trumpism is in the party so i think definitely like two questions you know 538 and myself will be asking moving forward is like what are we helping readers gain from this coverage and then what are we doing you know in our job to add to the discussion around trumpism and the influence that has in the party and moving beyond um trump the man as perry said all right well that was helpful for you know understanding how we'll be covering trump here at 5 38 and and the difficult questions that he poses still for journalism even once he's out of office i want to move on and talk about how the democratic party uh plans to address roadblocks to its agenda last week the senate parliamentarian who's a non-partisan official charged basically with interpreting the rules of the senate ruled that the federal minimum wage could not be raised through the reconciliation process in other words if democrats want to raise the minimum wage they either need to get 60 senators on board or come up with a policy workaround that could get some kind of minimum wage raise incentive through reconciliation otherwise they could take a more drastic approach like firing the parliamentarian or changing the rules of the filibuster so this is the first time that they're facing this dilemma but it's very unlikely to be the last so we want to talk about some of the debate within the party over what to do about it and we can broaden this out to some of the other policy areas but remaining on minimum wage for a moment what is the party thinking now about how it's going this is you know a key part of its agenda what it campaigned on in 2020 what do democrats want to do now about trying to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour nationally i mean i think they're gonna put it aside to get covet relief passed right yeah i mean there was talk that you know sanders and wyden were going to try to push through a corporate tax penalty as a way to do it they're abandoning that from what i can tell it seems as if right they'll table it for now and revisit it at some other point what does that mean though does that mean that it's kind of uh the minimum wage is not going to be raised over the next two years i think it's not going to pass yeah i think that i think bernie bernie sanders are telling people like this is the only way to get it past the next two years and the parliamentarian sort of gutted it i think i think this is this gets to the question about either they get rid of the filibuster or the minimum wage is not increased this is just binary that's it there's no like there's 10 republicans in the senate who would be open to raising it to like well somewhere close to 15. actually actually give me the basics um i think there might be 10 republic the question of whether you can raise it to 11 or 11.50 i don't see it but i think there might be some amount of like if they if there are some republicans who are moving a little bit i think romney and let's say either holly or cotton came out for i think 10 or 11 so maybe there's something in the middle 15 is definitely filibuster or bust but i think maybe there's some in the middle there between 750 and 15 but the flip of that though is i've seen that warren was like no it's 15. i won't do 11. and i mean again i don't think we're at this point that like 11 serious so that that could very well change but i think that's worth noting too that like even if they got to that i don't know if it would be a bipartisan measure you know what about it sounded like the alternative that some progressives including ilhan omar suggested was firing the senate parliamentarian and that would potentially allow democrats to get through more policies using reconciliation as opposed to doing away with the filibuster entirely does it seem like that is more likely than changing the rules of the filibuster or equally unlikely i think that's a zero and i think changing the filibuster might actually is a real discussion i don't think the joe biden party is interested in like the senate is great i love the senate they're not gonna i don't think they're gonna do that this is not something that i that's gonna feel to them kind of norm breaking in a way that like not just biden chris coons feinstein that's not gonna be popular they're not gonna do that and i think that points to like an important characteristic we're seeing about about democrats current approach to this um and this is this is something perry wrote about for the site but like the fundamental disagreement in the party right now is basically over like how much should we be behaving as business as usual basically um how much can we pursue our policy agenda using like the normal means that you know members of congress and administrations have used over the past 20 30 40 years um i think there's part of the party that thinks there is a sort of like structural breakdown has happened in the small d democratic systems of our country which makes um passing policies that the majority of the public like majority-backed policies um hard somewhere between hard and impossible um and that that camp is willing i think to like people often refer to it as like playing constitutional hardball um or you know i do stuff like fire the senate parliamentarian right because they think in the current system is so broken that you can't do the business as usual stuff to get your policies passed you have to um be willing to reform the system or or do huge kind of unprecedented end runs around the system so far at least i think we've seen that the the majority of democrats and the body administration are like not willing to to go there yet um that doesn't mean they might not go there eventually or they might not take steps in that direction but that's the basic the basic fault line right now is like how much of a of a emergency are is the country in um in terms of small democracy and from the democrat democrats point of view also big d democratic interests because they they right now the democratic party is more aligned with the majority of the country um and right now at least most democrats in power i think are not willing to like pull the fire alarm basically all right so that's where minimum wage stands but it sounds like the dynamic that you're describing micah is going to apply to a lot more of the democratic agenda than just the minimum wage so i'm curious perry you know what does it seem like can be accomplished by democrats leaving in place all of the rules and procedures that are currently there and how much of the agenda is dependent on whether or not democrats are willing to change the rules and procedures of the senate so you can put a lot in these reconciliation bills so it looks like all the minimum wage you can't so i think that they've got they've got obamacare changes in this the current bill now is obamacare changes it has uh money for states it has covertly it's not just a co-relief there's a ton of things i think might as well there's like a year's worth of policy in that bill so i think they're going to sort of push these bills as much as possible and add in stuff i think they're talking about adding in kind of legalization for undocumented immigrants in the next reconciliation bill again i think they're going to run into the barrier of reconciliation is not designed for non-sort of economic budget things so i think eventually you're going to so you so basically you have a lot of budget things you can pass you can appoint justices to the supreme court and lower courts um and that's those infrastructure you can infrastructure that's a good point actually infrastructure anything that involves like is really focused on spending money so infrastructure is a big thing that's in fact the next reconciliation bill they're talking about is infrastructure so healthcare you probably do a public option in a reconciliation but there's a lot of economic policy you can do so they could do two years worth of policy that would actually be pretty groundbreaking through reconciliation only you're not going to do anything around voting rights you're not gonna do much around immigration you're not gonna do much around um racial issues you're not gonna do much around police reform so there's still a big category of things that are not done but there's there's things you can do so maybe not surprisingly as long as the current structure and system is in place you cannot pass things to reform um or remake the current structure or system right like as perry was saying i think things that the democratic a lot of democratic activists see as like not only really important but like frankly fatal if not done for the party you know expanding the right to vote protecting the right to vote um for for voters of color in particular if if they they can't do those things through through reconciliation so i think at some point perry's right that like there is a lot they can do but i do think at some point someone's gonna look around in the party and be like it is a problem that we haven't done these other things and and then there will be a big fight on it i think that fight has to come right like there's going to be a big fight on the filibuster at some point right yeah the house is going to pass this hr1 this sort of voting reform end of gerrymandering bill they're also going to pass at some point what's called the john lewis voting rights act which is like basically a restoration of the things in this voting rights act that the supreme court uh kind of knocked out a few years ago so you're going to have these two voting rights bills that are going to be pushed they're going to be passed through the house and they're probably going to get to votes on the senate so the key thing here is like you're going to have voting rights bills that are not just supported by the aocs and the iona presleys but also like barack obama gave this quote about the filibuster we have to get rid of voting rights clyburn is on board for that so there's a core of democrats that are not sort of the most left who want to get rid of the filibuster not to add judges supreme court but to do sort of more increment of past voting rights stuff specifically minimum wage stuff that's going to be pretty popular and so that's where the fight is really going to be is between that group and the cinemas and the mansions and the feinsteins who say we just don't want to get rid of the filibuster that's what's coming probably later this year is what i suspect right and perry wrote about this but like you could see that debate particularly over voting rights be what kind of gets democrats to say you know what maybe we do get rid of the filibuster because one thing you know i hadn't fully realized was the extent to which the filibuster has been used to you know prevent civil rights legislation from happening right like that was a main mechanism in the 1950s and 60s to delay progress so there is that history there and that is something i think you know democrats who really want to push through and fight for um voting rights particularly given the extent to which various republican state governments now are making it harder to vote i think you could see a real fault line where it's no longer just this you know way in which the government works but the stakes are so much higher that someone like mansion maybe says okay i you know back getting rid of the filibuster i realized we are nowhere near there yet in terms of the conversation but um as perry is written for the site like i think we are headed in that direction right it's just much it's just like much easier for for the mansions and the cinemas of the world to stand by the filibuster when it's like you know should we have a 15 minimum wage or a or 11 12 minimum wage not that that's not important that's really important right um but just in terms of the politics of the democratic party um it'll be much harder for them to do that when it's like you as sarah said you have all these republican parties at the state level making it harder for black people to vote and then you know joe man joe manchin kirsten cinema is going to stand in the way of a bill that that is is meant to expand the vote like that's that's i think that's i'm not saying it that they'll flip because of it but it'll at least be harder not to flip so how does that pressure campaign work and where does the biden administration come into play because you can ima i mean you've certainly seen instances in the republican party going back to 2017 for example where you have like susan collins and lisa murkowski being like after saying that we're gonna repeal and replace the aca forever we're gonna stand in the way and not allow it to happen and the full force of the republican party being like no we gotta do this and i'm just saying no uh i think that the democratic party is probably more cohesive uh in many ways than the republican party was when you had like mcconnell pulling it in one direction and trump pulling it in another maybe that's true i don't know uh you can you can disagree with me if you want to but like how does the democratic party try to pressure mansion cinema feinstein into changing the rules of the filibuster on this on this is it up to biden like who's the how does it happen so short answer is this is a so in 20 uh i guess it's 2013 there were a lot of senators who had said i'm not going to change i'm not going to vote for filibuster changes and then eventually sort of obama pushed them to change the filibuster on supreme court or on like lower court nominees basically give her the filibuster on the lower courts manchin of course voted against that change to be fair and so um mansion and cinema are people who sort of sort of prize their independence they think part of their brand is i don't go along with the other the other um democrats in the same way that murkowski and collins i think is actually fairly similar is that they don't really go along with the party mansion is from a state that's very red only joe manchin i would argue probably can get elected there as a democrat so he's got particular power there also there's the mark kelly's the diane finds mark kelly's in a swing state he's not going to probably want to be out too far beyond where cinema is he's up in 2022 mark warner dianne feinstein tim kaine chris coons a lot of people who sort of like a more bipartisan senate who are also not going to be comfortable there i think the important part for biden is and is that biden has been part of this i think the senate is a great place i want bipartisanship to work so i think if so i think there's two pressure points one i think in arizona you're gonna have a lot of constituents really push cinema and call her and so on i don't think that's gonna make much of a difference uh and for mansion and that'll make no none of a difference but i do think if the case is made look we're the democratic party joe biden's leader of the party we want to win in 2022 and joe biden sort of leans on them as sort of like we need this to win in 2022 and because our we're the party of black people you need to jump on board on this voting issue because of the racial dynamics of our party that might be a different case and i don't know if i don't expect joe biden is going to fly to western and give a speech saying you know change these filibuster rules now i think it's going to be a much more subtle campaign and we may not know if it happens or not my guess is they can't in fact this may already be over it could be the case that joe meant that biden has already called joe manchin and cinema and they told him to you know f off and then this is sort of over in a certain way and all this is we don't really know i don't think i don't think biden is going to do this in public so i think that might be one place we don't actually know where this goes it it does really seem they're like a case where the position that biden sticks out even if only privately matters a lot i don't think it'll be determinative but it but it does seem like it would matter a lot the other thing i would say is like as perry was saying you know mansion cinema both of them have an incentive to carve out this kind of independent identity and therefore like even if eventually they will be okay you know sort of weakening the filibuster or carving making further carve outs of the filibuster you would still expect them to start from a position where they are now of saying no i'm against getting rid of the filibuster they wouldn't start from a place of like oh yeah whatever let's get rid of the filibuster right um they'll want that to appear they'll want to appear kind of reluctant and cautious and the reason that you know democrats aren't getting rid of the filibuster for everything but only in x y and z cases um so maybe it is already done but maybe it's like they've had a conversation they're like oh yeah we'll we'll back this more limited filibuster gutting rather than the kind of total makeover or something essentially saying that this is a lot of performance here and not really like strongly held beliefs or whatever i actually wanted to ask this before we do wrap up which is is this an ideological position for mansion cinema and others who are wary of changing the rules or is this an electoral consideration so are people worried that voters do actually want these you know guard rails in place and will penalize them for getting rid of them or is it just this is how i think the senate should work i like institutions and history and i want to keep this in place because of that so my impression is this is not this is not ideological this is much more about sort of which is why like dianne feinstein is she's not as left as people in california but like but she's pretty liberal on these issues mark warner is not you know he's he is more moderate but i think there are people who are kind of who have are sort of left on issues who still feel this way about um this i mean i'm assuming if you poll in west virginia increasing the minimum wage is actually really popular well minimum wage increases are very popular just broadly so it's hard for me to imagine a world in which mansion is hurt more by by like i think it's hard i would assume mansion is helped by a minimum wage increase and voting for it if you can i assume he would vote for something like this if they came up with another filibuster um his brand matters this is hard to figure out i think as i think this brand that mansion and cinema have probably is helpful and like the near a tandem thing like a much less important example so like an irritant has been nominated to run omb and manchin is the only democrat that's been against this then in public so far to me that seems like a free shot for manchin to say look i'm an independent person it's a high profile story that also really doesn't matter because biden will find another omb director in two hours if it came to that and so i think that's where i think the brand stuff does matter and i think that brand is electorally helpful to him i also think like you know largely polls have shown that democrats really do want congress to work together more so than republicans right like that is something that pew has consistently found right and the most recent survey was like 62 percent want biden to work with republicans even if it means disappointing some of his voters and that was that was the language of the poll and so like we'll see how that continues here in the next four years particularly as key parts of the democratic agenda is not able to be put through reconciliation um but at this point there's not really like a you know clear dividing line on the filibuster either like in the lead up to 2020 a um harvard's caps harris poll found that 52 said it would be a good idea to get rid of it 48 it would be a bad idea again though i don't know how much that has been something that has been talked about actively outside of really like leftist circles um increasingly though if that becomes the one avenue in which to kind of push through some of the democrats bigger agenda items i think you'll see more polarization around that area right yeah we can't like we don't believe right that like people care about the filibuster itself voters right we don't believe that right or that they like or that it it will be an animating issue that can't be the case right well i would assume that on specific policies no but that as a signaling mechanism yes right like we have talked about before that if a party is seen or a leader or a newly elected president is seen as overly partisan too liberal too conservative that can create some kind of backlash but that's not it's not going to be like people are just like devastated by the filibuster rules changes etc it's more like a signal that the party is more liberal right no totally but i guess my point then is like i i completely agree with that and it's why i think like you know mansion cinema's opposition to getting rid of the filibuster is more about branding than like um i actually would say that like some of the opposition to getting rid of the filibuster is about branding and some of it maybe other other senators is about more kind of like institutional um history or something but if it's just about signaling then it's just much more ephemeral right and then if like if you make a good argument if if if getting rid of the filibuster is attached to you know something let's say that has bipartisan support like like raising the minimum wage um then maybe you can overcome you can sort of switch what it signal what what it's a signal of right to sarah's point can you make the you know keeping the filibuster a signal of like racism frankly um can you make keeping the filibuster a signal of you know holding down wages for for working americans um maybe then you could you could you could kind of change the debate on it but just the fact that it is a signaling thing makes it much more fungible is that how you say that word um then if and then if people really cared about the issue itself right well we're sort of what i'm sort of mystified by and this is all is like i don't i've read a lot of pieces about mansion and cinema but i'd i would rather read more of them and less about donald j trump in the future if that was possible other reporters please you know so i'm sort of connected i actually am sort of interested in like this is our mansion and cinema not particularly invested in kind of i don't know how i don't actually know of races like their relationship to biden their investment in his presence it became very clear collins and murkowski did not have a particularly high view of trump or particularly strong investment in his political project and they wanted to make sure not to vote to ruin their own careers but i don't think they have much investment i don't have a good sense of whether mansion and cinema see themselves as capital d democrats in an important way or not really and i think that's the question because i guess it goes to this filibuster question overall because a lot of things in biden's agenda can't move without the filibuster moving but i don't know how much they care about that my mansion has been there for democrats on the biggest votes is that accurate to say i guess they i guess both of them voted for impeachment right so and that's is that the biggest vote yeah so i guess in some ways but on kavanaugh manchin only voted for kavanaugh after it became clear that he was already going to be uh the next supreme court justice so you're saying you guys are saying he's a team player in a lot of ways well that's right in your mouth sorry i didn't mean to put it that way you know at a certain at a certain point right and on certain issues you know is it's complicated you know like like is raising the minimum wage popular in west virginia yeah i would guess it is too you know is it popular in west virginia if it's like painted frankly as like you know a a program meant to benefit you know people of color and not white people even though that has no connection to like reality obviously um well then maybe it's not as popular in west virginia right so it's like it's just complicated i think manchin has shown in at least some circumstances he views himself as a capital d democrat and that means something but i'm i'm not sure i figured out like what what the what the defining characteristics of those circumstances is yet and therefore can predict what they will be in the future does that make sense it makes sense yeah so to answer your question before we wrap up here a new poll uh last week uh by one fair wage coalition so this is a poll that was conducted by an interest group 63 of west virginians support raising the min federal minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2025. so take that with a grain of salt because it is a partisan or at least interest group poll um but yeah so uh we will see what happens and this is a dynamic that we will continue to cover but that's going to be it for today so thank you perry sarah and micah all right thank you
